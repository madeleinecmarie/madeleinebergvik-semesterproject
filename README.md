This is a small e-commerce makeup and skincare website where you can buy cruelty free and vegan products. 

## Description

This project was my semester project 2021, and I made a e-commerce website selling makeup and skincare inspired by the swedish brand Caia Cosmetics. I was inspired by the girly colours and feeling. The design was made in Figma and coded it using Visual Studio Code using HTML, SASS and Javascript. I used Strapi to make the API and Heroku to deploy it. I also added a admin section to the website where you can easily edit, delete and add new products.
